# Rainfall_Prediction

# Overview
This GitHub repository hosts the "Rainfall Prediction" project, a machine learning project aimed at predicting rainfall in a given area based on historical weather data. The project demonstrates various machine learning models and typical procedures used in the field of data science and machine learning.

# Introduction
Rainfall prediction is crucial for various applications, including agriculture, disaster management, and water resource planning. This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict rainfall in a specific region based on historical weather data. We compare the performance of different machine learning models to showcase typical procedures in the field of data science and machine learning.



# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes historical weather data for a specific region, with features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The target variable is the amount of rainfall measured in millimetres.


# Results
The project compares the performance of various machine learning models for rainfall prediction. The evaluation metrics, visualizations, and insights are available in the Jupyter notebooks. You can refer to these results to make informed decisions about the choice of model and feature engineering techniques.
